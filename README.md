## API Overview
The TMDb (The Movie Database) API provides access to a rich, community-driven repository of movies, TV shows, and related media. You can fetch metadata such as titles, summaries, ratings, cast and crew details, posters, trailers, trending content, and much more—all in multiple languages, with high-quality imagery and flexible search and discovery endpoints.

## Authentication
You must register for an API key (Read Access Token) via the TMDb website. All requests require the token in the Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

## Error Handling
TMDb responds with structured JSON errors. For example, invalid credentials result in:
{ "status_code": 7, "status_message": "Invalid API key: You must be granted a valid key.", "success": false }
Handle errors by checking HTTP status codes and inspecting the status_code and status_message fields in the response.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

Rate Limits: The TMDb API enforces moderate rate limits (e.g., around 40 requests per 10 seconds). Be sure to cache responses and avoid unnecessary calls.

    Best Practices:

        Cache frequent or large requests (e.g., movie details, images)

        Use the append_to_response query param to fetch additional related data in a single call and minimize requests

        Always handle pagination for search or discovery endpoints

        Respect internationalization by specifying language parameters when needed
